# ðŸŽ¹ 1Keys
A 1 Kilobyte JavaScript Piano
By Frank Force 2019

This three instrument âˆ¿ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¹ piano supports play with both keyboard and mouse!

The keyboard setup mirrors the onscreen piano keyboard and allows playing simultaneous notes.

Keys light up red when played and can be held for any length of time.

Thanks to Rodrigo Siqueira for helping prototype this!
